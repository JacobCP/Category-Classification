Jupyter Notebook for NN and feature engineering exploration with the Kaggle Otto Group data set

Created this Notebook as part of an interview with an e-commerce website, who were looking at a similar problem.

First part of the notebook provides code for implementing logistic regression and NNs with Tensorflow.

Second part looks at different ideas for feature engineering.
